# 30 Days of JS ðŸš€

Welcome to the **30 Days of JS** challenge! In this repository, I will be working through a project each day, diving into JavaScript fundamentals, exploring its advanced concepts, and building hands-on mini-projects to improve my skills.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
- Learn JavaScript basics and beyond.
- Build real-world mini-projects each day.
- Gain confidence in JavaScript for building web applications.

## Project Structure
Each project will be placed in its respective folder named `Day-X`, where `X` is the day of the project. Each folder will include:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file for the project.
- `style.css` - CSS file for styling (if needed).
- `script.js` - JavaScript file with the project code.
